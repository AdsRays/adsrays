Creating an optimized production build...
Failed to compile.

Module not found: Error: You attempted to import /workspaces/adsrays/node_modules/react/jsx-runtime.js which falls outside of the project src/ directory. Relative imports outside of src/ are not supported.
You can either move it inside src/, or add a symlink to it from project's node_modules/.
